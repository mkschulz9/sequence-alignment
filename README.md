# Sequence Alignment Solutions - CSCI-570 Spring 2024 Final Project

- Welcome to our CSCI-570 Spring 2024 Final Project repository. This project focuses on the practical implementation of two distinct algorithms to solve the Sequence Alignment problem. These solutions encompass a dynamic programming approach and a memory-efficient strategy combining dynamic programming with divide-and-conquer.

## Sequence Alignment Problem
- The Sequence Alignment problem is a classic problem in bioinformatics that involves finding the optimal alignment between two sequences. The goal is to identify the best alignment that minimizes the total cost of matching, mismatching, and gap penalties. More detailed information about the Sequence Alignment problem can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment).
